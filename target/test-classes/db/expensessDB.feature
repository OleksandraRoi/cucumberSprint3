@DB
  Feature: User Story 4

    As a user of the Duobank Mortgage Application, I want to be able to easily provide and update
    information related to my current living situation and expenses through the Expenses page of the
    mortgage application. I expect this information to be securely stored in a database schema designed
    by the database developer to ensure the safety of my personal and financial data.

@db_only2
  Scenario: The database schema should have "tbl_mortagage" table that can store user information
  related to their living situation and expenses
    Given The database contains expenses page information
    |rent_own_status|
    |monthly_rental_payment|
    |first_mortagage_total_payment|

@uiSide2
  Scenario: Filling out UI side with Rent and Own checkboxes
    Given The user filling out form with Rent check box
    Given The user filling out form with Own check box

  @db_only2
  Scenario: The "rent_own_status" field should only allow two values, "Rent" and "Own".
    Then On the database the rent_own_status should have only Rent or Own values
    |Rent|
    |Own |

  @db_only2
  Scenario: The "monthly_rental_payment" and "first_mortgage_total_payment" fields should only allow
  positive numeric values
    Then The monthly_rental_payment field should have only positive numeric values
    And The first_mortgage_total_payment field should have only positive numeric values

@mapping2
  Scenario: Upon successful submission of the page information, the "Expenses" page form fields should be
  mapped to their corresponding columns in the “tbl_mortagage” table in the database
    Given The user is filling out the form with the next input
      |rent_own_status|first_mortagage_total_payment|
      |Own            |5000                        |
    Then The input information should be mapped in database correctly
      |rent_own_status|first_mortagage_total_payment|
      |Own            |5000                        |
